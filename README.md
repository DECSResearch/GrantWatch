# GrantWatch
GrantWatch is a Python-based monitoring bot that continuously downloads, filters, and summarizes grant opportunities, then notifies users via email. It applies a series of date- and content-based checks before delivering only the most relevant, up-to-date listings.

  - Optionally removes ‚ÄúForecasted‚Äù opportunities  
- **Keyword Filtering** via LLM-generated keywords on `FUNDING_DESCRIPTION`  
- **LLM Summarization** of filtered grants into concise descriptions  
- **Sorting** by most-recent `POSTED_DATE`  
- **Gmail Notification** of final results  
- **Extensible Structure** for future vector-store / agent integration
