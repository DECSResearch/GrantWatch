In upcoming releases, we plan to evolve GrantWatch from a simple scraper-notifier bot into an LLM-backed AI agent with Retrieval-Augmented Generation capabilities:

1. Emails : As soon as grants release (Gmail - API/token)
2. Docs checker : Check all the required docs are present (Doc Upload)
3. Doc Inconsistency Checker : Check if all the info is aligned (Doc Upload)
4. Fliter : Concept/Full proposal, Due Dates (PostgreSQL)
5. Suggestions/ Best Matches : User intrests and suggest best matches (RAG)
6. ChatBot : Query - RAG
