The USGS Great Lakes Science Center (GLSC) has specific authorities under the Great Lakes Fisheries Research Authorization Act (H.R. 1865, Title II) to conduct fisheries research to ""...execute a comprehensive, multi-lake, freshwater fisheries science program..."" to support management decision making by parties to the Great Lakes Council of Lake Committees (CLC). Under this authority, GLSC works across the Great Lakes basin to carry out annual lake-wide surveys of prey fish abundances; answer discrete research questions about fish, limnology, and ecosystems; map habitats; and develop technological solutions to persistent or imperfect sampling problems. GLSC""s science products support the information needs of the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission, parties to the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, the International Joint Commission, and other regional and national partners. The work of GLSC is critical to maintaining the economic prosperity of Americans that rely on fisheries for revenue generation.Multiple Great Lakes fish stocks are in decline due to a combination of factors ranging from invasive species to habitat degradation. Lake whitefish is one such species. One impediment to healthy stocks of lake whitefish and similar species is degradation of habitats where they deposit their eggs and hatch their young. USGS is engaged in research to understand and hopefully alleviate impediments to fisheries productivity to help maintain American prosperity, which in the Great Lakes is supported by $7B in annual revenues from fisheries related industries.This funding opportunity is for a cooperator to assist with our understanding of how lake-bed habitats contribute to fisheries success. Specifically, a need exists to develop high-resolution maps of habitats that can be used to support ongoing studies of the role of habitat in fish production. The successful cooperator will use underwater images collected by USGS""s autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to map habitats at the very high resolutions using photogrammetric techniques like Structure from Motion. USGS lacks expertise in underwater photogrammetry needed to convert their raw data into maps that can help understand fish hatching and rearing success. To fulfill their mandate to support Great Lakes fisheries managers, GLSC must bring their knowledge and datasets together with a cooperator with knowledge of the technologies and photogrammetry to pursue joint research objectives.</p>"

The NOFO will support rigorous and well-powered mechanistic research studies that are supported by strong preliminary data.  The studies should examine the effects of mind and body interventions on innovative mechanisms of EWB (as the primary outcome), as well as the associated relationship with the Whole Person Health Index (WPHI, as a secondary outcome). To enhance research safety, rigor, and efficiency of NIH-funded mechanistic clinical trials, this initiative will use a two-phased award funding mechanism (R61/R33). The funding will support an initial phase (R61) to establish feasibility benchmarks for the proposed mechanistic clinical trial(s), followed by a second phase (R33) to complete the full-scale trials, which will be contingent upon successful completion of R61 milestones. Applications should provide preliminary data that are comparable in quality and quantity to those expected for an R01 proposal."

The overarching goal for the Accelerating Research Translation (ART) program is to advance the U.S. scientific and economic leadership by building capacity and increasing the number of robust translational research ecosystems in Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) that span across the full geography of our nation.&#8239;Innovations can occur anywhere and can be opportunities for creating sustained impacts in every single region of the United States. Achieving translational outcomes as a mechanism to drive sustained economic impacts is the primary aim of the ""Accelerating Research Translation"" (ART) program. <a id=""_anchor_1"" name=""_msoanchor_1"" href=""https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?file:///C:/Users/hmehta/Desktop/ART%20Solicitation%20final/ART%2003-24-2025/ART%20solicitation_gln_pf%20clean%20document.docx#_msocom_1""></a>


 


Led by NSFs Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP) and in collaboration with other NSF directorates and the Office of Integrative Activities, the ART program seeks proposals involving institutional leadership; research translation programs, institutes or centers; technology transfer offices; units responsible for managing research intellectual property (IP); entrepreneurial training teams; and researchers from all scientific, technological and engineering fields in collaboration with one or more of the other target categories mentioned below.  This updated ART solicitation expands and builds upon its previous version, <a href=""https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/art-accelerating-research-translation/nsf23-558/solicitation"">NSF 23-558</a>, by implementing Tracks that address varying stages of capacity to accelerate research translation.


  


The ART program is aimed at providing resources that will ultimately facilitate a wide range of IHEs to achieve research translation, accelerate technology transfer, and create sustained economic and collective impacts across the U.S. It is understood that, like technology readiness levels (TRLs), there is no one measure or a combination of measures that can be used to describe the capacity of or measure the research translation readiness level (RTRL) for an IHE.  Some indicators that reflect on RTRL include volume of sustained basic and applied research as measured by research expenditures, robust technology transfer and entrepreneurship related activities (e.g. invention disclosures, patents, licenses, royalties, partnerships with industry, non-profits etc.).  Number of start-ups, resources for entrepreneurial and innovation education and training, the presence of a dedicated technology transfer office are also some of the other indicators that reflect on the RTRL.


 


Some of the criteria that may help identify the RTRL for an IHE are shown in Figure 1.  Typically, an IHE with low RTRL is likely to have very few patent, licensing, or start-ups related activities, while as these activities will be at a higher level for an IHE with a medium RTRL, whereas an IHE with high RTRL would likely have established tech transfer office with an an extensive record of technology transfer activities including patenting, licensing and creation of  startups, as well as extensive education, training, networking opportunities related to tech transfer and entrepreneurship. For the purpose of this solicitation, the illustration below provides some descriptors that may be useful in deciding which Track may be the best fit for a proposing organization. It is ultimately up to a proposing organization to determine which Track may present the best alignment for their submission.

 Fig 1: Research Translation Readiness Level

</div>
</div>

The ART program seeks proposals that have a blend of: (1) activities that will help build and/or strengthen the institutional infrastructure to sustainably grow the institutional capacity for research translation in the short and long terms; (2) educational/training opportunities, especially in engaged scholarship and experiential opportunities for students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty, to become entrepreneurial leads (EL) and/or seek use-inspired- and/or technology transfer- and research translation-oriented careers in the public and/or private sectors; and (3) specific, research translation and technology transfer activities that offer immediate opportunities for transition to practice to create sustained economic and collective impacts. Importantly, NSFs definitions of research translation and technology transfer go beyond a traditional focus on lab-to-market pathways leading to new startups and small businesses; rather, NSF aims to grow capacity at IHEs to achieve the full range of translational impacts emanating from research discoveries and innovations by including civic entrepreneurship; informing standards-setting, policy, and regulatory bodies; scaling rigorous and engaging curricula, instructional material, and pedagogies; and more.


 


The ART program framework is built around five distinct Tracks that are interconnected. These Tracks are differentiated by the RTRL. Track 1 is designed and intended for IHEs that currently have a low to medium RTRL. The IHEs responding to Track 1 are expected to have on-going research that has potential and opportunity for innovation translation but the infrastructure and the ecosystem for creating such opportunities for research translation are very limited.  On the other hand, Track 2 is designed and intended for IHEs with some modest infrastructure and ecosystem that has a high volume of research but overall low level of research translation. Tracks 3 and 4 are designed and intended for IHEs or non-profits that have a significantly higher RTRL (or equivalent experience) and can create and deliver entrepreneurship-, technology transfer related education and training materials and offer related services to IHEs that have a much lower RTRL. Track 5 is designed and intended for providing support to an IHE that can coordinate research translation-related activities for teams across all the other Tracks.  


 


Track 1: Accelerating Technology Transfer (ACT)  

<ul type=""disc"">
<li>This is an opportunity for only IHEs that have a low to medium level of overall research and can demonstrate potential for identifying and acting on opportunities for economic benefits by starting to build capacity for innovation translation. A Track 1 award is expected to be up to a total of $3 million for a duration of 3 years. The proposal must be led by and focused on outcomes of one IHE. Subject to availability of funds and quality of proposals, NSF plans to make up to 20 awards under the ACT Track. ACT awardees demonstrating strong performance, as demonstrated by successfully meeting evaluation criteria during the award may have an opportunity to receive renewal support for up to 2 more years and total funding up to $1 million, subject to the availability of funds.</li>
</ul>

Track 2: Growing Capacity for Research Translation (GROW)   

<ul type=""disc"">
<li>This is an opportunity for only IHEs that currently have a high level of research with a modest research translation infrastructure in place but where the level of research translation remains relatively low. This Track 2 is aimed at IHEs that have a high potential and desire to substantially elevate the overall level of research translation to unleash innovation and create significant opportunities for sustained economic and collective impacts. The proposal must be led by and focused on outcomes of one IHE in partnership with one mentoring IHE with a high RTRL. A Track 2 award may be budgeted for up to a total of $6 million for a duration of 4 years. Subject to availability of funds and quality of proposals, NSF plans to make up to 10 awards under this Track.   </li>
</ul>

 Track 3: Technology Transfer Resource Centers (RESOURCE)   

<ul type=""disc"">
<li>The ART program aims to leverage the experience and resources of IHEs or non-profits with strong research translation capacity (and/or experience) to launch a network of regional Technology Transfer Resource Centers (RESOURCE) that promote regional technology transfer and technology development activities available to multiple IHEs in a region with low or emerging research capacity and little or no dedicated technology transfer or research translation resources.  A Track 3 award for a RESOURCE is expected to provide guidance, training, education, and services to other IHEs in a region who have a low RTRL. A Track 3 award is expected to be up to a total of $8 million for a duration of 4 years. Subject to availability of funds and quality of proposals, NSF plans to make up to 5 RESOURCE awards. Some awardees demonstrating strong performance, as demonstrated by successfully meeting evaluation criteria during the award, including progress toward self-sustainability, may have an opportunity to receive renewal support for up to 4 more years and additional funding of up to $2 million, subject to the availability of funds. As noted above, the lead IHE for this Track is expected to be an IHE with a very high RTRL or a non-profit with significant expertise related to technology transfer, entrepreneurship and related areas leading to sustained economic impacts.      </li>
</ul>

 Track 4: Education and Training (ET)    

<ul type=""disc"">
<li>

This nationally focused Track invites proposals from IHEs or non-profits with any combination of either a strong, vibrant and established research translation ecosystem, and/or demonstrated experience to develop, evaluate, and deploy educational and training resources related to entrepreneurship, technology transfer and related activities. The beneficiaries for these education and training resources to be developed will be lower RTRL IHEs located anywhere in the United States (including but not limited to Track 1 and Track 2 awardees). Track 4 awards may be budgeted up to a total of $3 million for a duration of 3 years. Subject to availability of funds and quality of proposals, NSF plans to make up to 4 ET awards. Some awardees demonstrating strong performance, as demonstrated by successfully meeting evaluation criteria during the award, including progress toward self-sustainability, may have an opportunity to receive renewal support for up to 2 more years and additional funding up to $2 million (subject to the availability of funds), to scale up the deployment and adoption of the developed resources and training materials nationally.

The TA provider will develop a comprehensive asset map of resources and potential new partners for each state that can be leveraged to address the out-of-care population. The TA provider will organize and facilitate meetings with all the RWHAP Parts in each state using a tailored approach to best meet the needs of local recipients; this may include virtual preparatory meetings in addition to the in-person statewide meeting. Key state-level officials, such as the state health officers, will be invited to participate in the state-wide meetings to engage their support.  With the assistance of the TA provider, participants will develop an action plan with concrete steps to reach people with HIV that are out of care and engage them in sustained HIV care. States will be identified based on unmet need data with a focus on states that are not receiving Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. initiative (EHE) funds. Addressing unmet need for care and treatment and increasing viral suppression helps to reduce HIV transmission as people who are virally suppressed cannot transmit HIV to their sexual partners. This is important as 87 percent of new HIV infections come from people with HIV who have not yet been successfully engaged in care."

Georgia relies on imports for 72% of its poultry meat consumption, with the U.S. supplying $12.6m of poultry products in 2024. U.S. poultry products have a significant presence in Georgia, but face competition from other countries, including Brazil, China and Ukraine. Additionally, Georgia serves as an important transshipment point for U.S. poultry meat among the South Caucasus and Central Asian countries. U.S. exports are often challenged by Georgian food safety requirements and quality standards; to the extent feasible, within the training program the recipient should underscore the U.S. poultry industry’s ability to comply with these standards. USDA/FAS’s objective for this program is to increase importer and processor knowledge of the benefits of the U.S. poultry industry, with the goal of increasing the sale of U.S. poultry meat for export to Georgia and the neighboring region. The training program implemented by the recipient should increase the Georgian participants’ capacity for participation in Georgian trade with U.S. exporters.</p><p>The training program should provide an in-depth overview of the U.S. poultry industry, ranging from production to consumption. The program should include education on processing, distribution, and marketing, with emphasis on quality control, supply chain management, compliance with local and Georgian food safety regulations, food safety certification, and the benefits of sourcing U.S. poultry meat. The recipient must facilitate business-to-business meetings between U.S. poultry industry actors and the Georgian participants, and/or participation in a related trade show to foster linkages with U.S. businesses, done in coordination with USDA/FAS, who will manage coordination with USA Poultry &amp; Egg Export Council (USAPEEC). The emphasis of the training is expected to be on chicken meat as well as turkey meat.</p><p>The recipient shall educate the Georgian participants in the following areas:</p><p>1. The benefits of poultry meat from U.S. suppliers;</p><p>2. The United States’ innovative and advanced poultry production, processing and marketing;</p><p>3. Connections to U.S. suppliers of poultry meat and other products/ingredients;</p><p>4. U.S food safety and other regulations related to the poultry industry and quality control; and</p><p>5. U.S. poultry export, distribution and promotion.</p>"

The National Park Service American Battlefield Protection Program (NPS ABPP) promotes the preservation and interpretation of these important places. NPS ABPP supports community-driven stewardship of historic resources through four grant opportunities: Preservation Planning, Battlefield Restoration, Battlefield Interpretation, and Battlefield Land Acquisition. NPS ABPP administers the Battlefield Restoration Grant opportunity to provide assistance for the restoration of day-of-battle conditions within eligible Civil War battlefields listed in the Civil War sites Advisory Commission's (CWSAC) Report on the Nation's Civil War Battlefields (1993) and in the principal battlefields of the Revolutionary War and War of 1812 identified in NPS ABPP""s Report to Congress on the Historic Preservation of Revolutionary War and War of 1812 Sites in the United States (2007) (Survey Reports). Restoration sites must be located outside the external boundaries of a unit of the National Park System and must have been protected with assistance from a NPS""s Battlefield Land Acquisition Grant (BLAG) established under 54 U.S.C. §308103(b), be owned by state or local government entities (e.g., state or local battlefield parks), OR owned by a nonprofit organization, and located within the boundaries of battlefields listed in the Survey Reports. Funding from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) will support planning and implementation activities for historic preservation projects at eligible properties and will be awarded competitively. Grants require a dollar-for-dollar non-Federal match. Two categories of grants are available for activities supporting the restoration efforts at eligible properties:Scoping Grants are available to fund early stages of project development, such as research, documentation, and evaluation to determine appropriate treatment options that meet the Secretary of the Interior""s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and Guidelines for the Treatment of Historic Landscapes; consultation with stakeholders; development of comprehensive treatment and management plans, schematic designs, and/or specifications. The Federal share for these planning grants should range from $30,000-$100,000 and have a period of performance of 1 to 2 years.Implementation Grants are available to applicants who have completed planning activities prior to application. These include evaluation of historic resources, and identification if preservation, rehabilitation, or restoration is the most appropriate and viable option according to the Secretary of the Interior""s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and Guidelines for the Treatment of Historic Landscapes, prior to application. Proposed treatments may include reconstruction of specific features or elements within a landscape, provided there is adequate documentation and differentiation of new and historical elements. Total reconstructions of buildings or landscapes that no longer retain any integrity to the period of the battle are not eligible, as they serve purposes of interpretation rather than historic preservation. The applicant must provide planning documentation as part of the application that sufficiently addresses the Standards and Guidelines and evaluation of historic resources (see Application Review). The Federal share for these grants should range from $50,000-$750,000 and have a period of performance of 2 to 5 years.Land developed with these funds will be subject to the LWCF non-conversion requirements. Nonprofit partners with title on eligible lands must convey a perpetual preservation easement on the land to the appropriate State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) or to another organization acceptable to the National Park Service and SHPO."

As an ongoing effort to engage all Americans in the preservation of cultural resources beyond our park boundaries, the National Park Service American Battlefield Protection Program (NPS ABPP) promotes the preservation and interpretation of these important places. NPS ABPP awards financial assistance to support community-driven stewardship of battlefields and sites of armed conflict through four grant opportunities: Preservation Planning, Battlefield Restoration, Battlefield Interpretation, and Battlefield Land Acquisition.NPS ABPP administers Battlefield Interpretation Grants to provide assistance for projects that deploy technology to modernize and enhance battlefield interpretation and education at Revolutionary War, War of 1812, and Civil War battlefield sites eligible for assistance under the Battlefield Acquisition Grant Program established under 54 U.S.C. §308103(b). These grants are funded from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which invests earnings from offshore oil and gas leasing to help strengthen communities, preserve history and protect the national endowment of lands and waters. Funding will support scoping and implementation activities for historic preservation projects at eligible sites and will be awarded competitively. Grants require a dollar-for-dollar non-Federal match. State, local, and tribal governments, as well as nonprofit organizations are eligible to apply.Battlefield Interpretation Grants empower recipients to modernize and enhance battlefield education and interpretation - to inspire wonder, understanding and empathy at the places that witnessed some of our nation's most challenging events. This grant program encourages the use of technology to connect with visitors through videos, mobile apps, interpretive signs, augmented reality and more. Battlefield Interpretation Grants seek an enhanced user experience where the application of ""technology"" and understanding of ""modernize"" is keyed to the user. Who is the audience, and how do these elements engage them? The user experience also relates to the narratives shared that can be ""modernized."" What audiences are missing, and how might these elements engage them?Two categories of grants are available for battlefield interpretation projects in different stages: Scoping Grants: These are available to fund the early stages of project development, such as research and content creation, consultation with stakeholders, exploration of available technologies, audience research, and development of technical proposals. The federal share for these grants should range from $20,000-$50,000 and have a period of performance of 1-2 years.Implementation Grants: These are available to applicants who have completed interdisciplinary scoping prior to the application and can provide draft content and design plans. The federal share for these grants should range from $50,000-$200,000 and have a period of performance of 2-3 years. It is not necessary for an applicant to receive or complete a Scoping Grant prior to applying for an Implementation Grant, but their Implementation Grant application must show that the prerequisite steps of project development have been completed to be viable. On a case-by-case basis, the length of a project period of performance may differ from the above recommendations. As the nation approaches the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in 2026, NPS ABPP encourages projects that promote and expand preservation as well as enhance our understanding of the origins of the United States."

Programmable Cloud Laboratories are able to execute automated workstreams, including self-driving lab workflows, to efficiently move research goals through artificial intelligence (AI) enabled experiment design, laboratory preparations, data collection, data analysis and interpretation. While limited-scale efforts have shown promise, versatile programmable and self-driving labs capable of addressing complex research questions with trustworthy results will require coordinated technological advances and an engaged research community. Additional challenges include the availability of automated laboratory infrastructure, standardized approaches to data collection for interoperability, advances in AI for data interpretation and experimental design, and more. This solicitation aims to address such gaps and realize the potential of autonomous experimentation.


The Test Bed: Toward a Network of Programmable Cloud Laboratories (PCL Test Bed) program seeks to establish and facilitate the operation of distributed autonomous laboratory facilities. These laboratories will combine technological and human capacity to enable integration, testing, evaluation, validation, and translation of cutting-edge technology solutions in automated science and engineering. The PCL Test Bed will consist of a set of Programmable Cloud Laboratory Nodes (PCL Nodes) that can be remotely accessed to run custom workflows specified and programmed by users, that are linked together via computational networking, shared science questions, and data and artificial intelligence (AI) standards.


The PCL Test Bed will facilitate access to advanced scientific equipment, accelerate translation and scaling of basic research into industry applications, enhance reproducibility and the exchange of experimental data, and assist in training the next generation of scientists and engineers in state-of-the art methodologies. It will help develop community norms, best practices, and formal standards for automated laboratory procedures, workflows, and instrument testing and validation. It will also advance consistent practices for the collection, sharing, and use of metadata and training data and the use and exploitation of AI methods. This program will also support the development of automated laboratory methods, including self-driving autonomous experiment workflows.


Proposals must have a set of well-defined science drivers poised to derive significant benefit from targeted use of the PCL Test Bed capabilities, including but not limited to synthesis, optimization, and/or characterization experiments, in specific sub-disciplines within materials science, biotechnology, chemistry or other areas of science and engineering. These science drivers will guide the protocols and standards necessary for each node and facilitate collaboration across the Test Bed. For example, science drivers could include but are not limited to:

<ul>
<li>Materials science, materials synthesis and characterization efforts that advance U.S. competitiveness.</li>
<li>Biotechnology experiments in scalable, high-throughput engineering and characterization services for proteins or microbes with novel applications in the U.S. bioeconomy.</li>
<li>High-throughput experimentation for the accelerated development of catalysts to support more efficient chemical synthesis to address urgent national needs.</li>
</ul>

User Recruitment and On-Boarding Workshops will be a key component of the PCL Test Bed program and will serve to recruit users to individual PCL Nodes and the Test Bed to help make progress on the proposed science drivers, provide access to technology, test the limits of the experimental set-up of the nodes, and explore new research opportunities between the PCL Nodes and institutions including, but not limited to, R2 Universities, PUI (Primarily Undergraduate Institutions), and two-year institutions.


The PCL Test Bed will be available to researchers in academia as well as industry, including current and former awardees from the Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) programs. The portfolio of projects is available here,<a href=""https://seedfund.nsf.gov/portfolio/"">https://seedfund.nsf.gov/portfolio</a>.


PCL Nodes are expected to develop and implement plans for continued operation after the period of this award."

PIs are expected to have little or no experience conducting social science or education research. PFE: RIEF is not intended for established researchers in engineering education or other social science fields to initiate new projects. Those researchers should consider the Research in the Formation of Engineers program (https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505681).</div>
<div></div>
<div>The NSF Engineering (ENG) Directorate has launched a multi-year initiative, the Professional Formation of Engineers, to create and support an innovative and inclusive engineering profession for the 21st Century. Professional Formation of Engineers (PFE) refers to the formal and informal education and value systems by which people become engineers. It also includes the ethical responsibility of practicing engineers to sustain and grow the profession. The engineering profession must be responsive to national priorities, grand challenges, and dynamic workforce needs; it must be equally open and accessible to all.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Engineering faculty possess both deep technical expertise in their engineering discipline and the primary responsibility for the process of professional formation of future engineers. As such, engineering faculty are in a unique position to help address critical challenges in engineering formation. The Professional Formation of Engineers: Research Initiation in Engineering Formation (PFE: RIEF) program enables engineering faculty who are renowned for teaching, mentoring, or leading educational reform efforts on their campus to develop expertise in conducting engineering education research.</div>"

NASEM Astrobiology Strategy citation was corrected to 2019 (see Section 1.1.3), reference to the anonymized Table of Work Effort was added to Section 3.2, and HEC request is not included in anonymized proposal (see Section 3.5). New text is in bold and deleted text is struck through.</strong></p> 
<p><br></p> 
<p><strong>NOTICE: ROSES-25 Amendment 7 makes the following changes to C.1 the Planetary Research Overview: It establishes funding threshold and submission requirements for substantial instrument or equipment requests (Section 3.11), removes the estimated page limit for pilot studies (Section 3.4) and clarifies text on use of spacecraft mission data (Section 3.5). New text is in bold and deleted text is struck through. A Planetary Science Overview FAQ has been posted under other documents on NSPIRES pages for all of Appendix C. </strong></p> 
<p><br></p> 
<p><strong>NOTICE: Amended August 1, 2025. This amendment makes several changes: It establishes that the anonymized Table of Work Effort and references are outside of the 5-page S/T/M section (see Section 3.2), removes an exclusion regarding data archiving (see Section 2.1), changes the first proposal submission cut-off date for inclusion in the Winter 2025 review to September 15, 2025, changes the second estimated review date to Spring 2026 (see Table C.2-1 in Section 3.1), and removes the HEC requirement in the S/T/M as it appears as a cover page question, see Section 3.2.

25-540,National Science Foundation Translation to Practice,Posted,07/09/2025,01/20/2026,,,,,,research; education; innovation; technology,"<p class=""pf0"">The U.S. NSF <a href=""https://new.nsf.gov/tip/latest"">Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships</a> (NSF TIP) partners across sectors to advance three primary focus areas &ndash; accelerating technology translation and development, fostering regional innovation and economic growth, and prep...","<p class=""pf0"">The U.S. NSF <a href=""https://new.nsf.gov/tip/latest"">Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships</a> (NSF TIP) partners across sectors to advance three primary focus areas &ndash; accelerating technology translation and development, fostering regional innovation and economic growth, and preparing the American workforce for future high-wage jobs in STEM fields.


The translation of research to practice ensures that the insights and innovations developed through scientific study and experimentation have tangible, positive impacts for the Nation. These impacts include improving the quality of life, promoting economic and job growth, ensuring national security, and maintaining global competitiveness. Indeed, scientific and engineering breakthroughs have the potential to address critical societal challenges in industries such as aerospace, agriculture, communications, education, energy, healthcare, national security, and transportation &ndash; but the translation of discoveries and innovations from the laboratory to society often takes many forms including non-linear pathways.


The NSF TTP program was developed with several goals in mind:

<ul>
<li>To identify and support use-inspired research and translational activities enabling a continuum from foundational research to practice;</li>
<li>To develop partnerships and collaborations between institutions of higher education and other entities (e.g., industry, state/local/national government agencies, philanthropies, open-source ecosystems, for-benefit, for-profit and non-profit organizations, international organizations, etc.);</li>
<li>To promote and advance the education and training of students and postdoctoral researchers, encouraging the participation of all Americans in STEM including innovation and entrepreneurship; and</li>
<li>To identify future customer needs and opportunities and bring these to the forefront in the conduct of use-inspired research and translational activities.</li>
</ul>

The NSF TTP program offers three tracks that represent different starting points or stages in moving discoveries and innovations from the laboratory to practice:

<ul>
<li>NSF TTP-Explore (NSF TTP-E) is a pilot track that is likely to be the first step for researchers seeking to translate their basic research to practice. To be eligible for the NSF TTP-E track, proposers must have an active, eligible, NSF research award (see Eligibility Information for further details). TTP-E is designed to encourage current, eligible NSF awardees to intentionally pursue applications of their research with the potential for societal impact. The NSF TTP-E track provides the opportunity to obtain an extension of the initial award period of a current NSF award for up to two years in order to offer investigators an opportunity to explore adventurous, high-risk, use-inspired research and initial translational activities as the starting point for translation that was not covered by the original research award.</li>
<li>NSF TTP-Translate (NSF TTP-T) starts with use-inspired research and initial translational activities and further matures the idea(s), iterates and improves the solution(s), and lowers the barrier(s) to effective translation of research from lab to practice.</li>
<li>NSF TTP-Partner (NSF TTP-P) supports translational efforts that demand one or more partnerships for technology development and deployment. Here, strategic partnerships with stakeholders beyond U.S. institutions of higher education are essential ingredients for success and may include industry partners, government entities at all levels, philanthropies, international organizations, or other groups associated with large scale productization and distribution. The NSF TTP-P track requires an NSF-Catalyzed Partnership with an organization that will assist in the translation to practice. In addition to the Principal Investigator (PI), NSF TTP-P proposals must include a co-PI or Senior/Key Personnel who is a member or employee of the NSF-Catalyzed Partner. Partnerships with U.S. institutions of higher education are valued, but NSF TTP strongly prioritizes NSF-Catalyzed Partnerships that are able to help bring the product, process, or service to the market, potentially through licensing agreements, startup or small business formation, incorporation into an existing open-source ecosystem, development into standards setting arrangements, etc.</li>

CCIs are agile structures that can respond rapidly to emerging opportunities through enhanced collaborations. CCIs integrate research with strong broader impacts, including innovation, education, broadening participation, andinformal science communication.


The CCI Program is a two-phase program. Both phases are described in this solicitation. Phase I CCIs receive significant resources to develop the science, management and broader impacts of a major research center before requesting Phase II funding. Satisfactory progress in Phase I is required for Phase II applications; Phase I proposals funded in FY 2024 will seek Phase II funding in FY 2027.


The FY 2024 Phase I CCI competition is open to projects in all fields supported by the Division of Chemistry, and must have scientific focus and the potential for transformative impact in chemistry.The NSF Division of Chemistry particularly encourages fundamental chemistry projects aligned with articulated budget priorities, including Advanced Manufacturing, Artificial Intelligence, Semiconductor Research, Biotechnology, Climate Research and Sustainability, Clean Energy, and Quantum Information Science.<a title=""here"" href=""https://www.nsf.gov/about/budget/fy2021/pdf/27_fy2021.pdf""><br /></a>


The FY 2024 Phase II CCI competition is open to projects funded as Phase I awards in FY 2021.
